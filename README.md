# Work Day Scheduler

This project is a scheduling tool to be used for the hours of a typical 9-5 workday.
A memo can be entered into each hour slot and then saved to local storage with the save button on the right-hand side.

Each hour's corresponding row will change color based how it relates to the current time of day:
  *Green if the hour is in the future
  *Gray if hour has passed
  *Red is for if the the hour is the current time
